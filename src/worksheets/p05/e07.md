# Ejercicio 7

```
maxl :: Ord a => [a] -> a
maxl [] = 0 
maxl (x : xs) = x ‘max‘ maxl xs 

sum :: Num a => [a] -> a
sum [] = 0
sum (x : xs) = x + sum xs

-- Extra

length :: [a] -> Int
length [] = 0
length (x : xs) = 1 + length xs
```

## Demostración: sum xs <= length xs ∗ maxl xs

### Caso base []

```
sum []
= <def. sum .1>
0
<= <prop. <= >
0 * 0
= <def. length. 1, def. maxl .1> 
(length []) * (maxl [])
```

### Paso inductivo x : xs

#### HI: sum xs <= length xs ∗ maxl xs

```
sum (x : xs)
= <def. sum .1>
x + sum xs
<= <HI>
x + length xs ∗ maxl xs
<= <def. max, prop <= >
x + (x `max` maxl xs) * (length xs)
<= <def. max, prop <= >
(x `max` maxl xs) + (x `max` maxl xs) * (length xs)
<= <prop. distributiva>
(x `max` maxl xs) * (1 + length xs)
<= <def. maxl .2, def. length .2>
(length (x : xs)) * (maxl (x : xs)) 
```
